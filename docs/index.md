# Getting Started with Inbind
Welcome to Inbind! This guide will get you started quickly to manage your content more efficiently in Inbind.

## What is Inbind?

Inbind is a content management system designed specifically for the needs of content managers. It connects to platforms like Webflow, Webstudio, and static site frameworks (Astro, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit) in the simplest way possible. Inbind provides a centralized workspace to view, edit, and manage content through improved text editing, support for tables, and an intuitive interface.

## How it works?

Inbind automatically synchronizes with your connected systems. You can create new items, save them as drafts, and see them reflected on your websites. When you’re ready to publish, you can publish directly from Inbind without switching tools.

## Key Features

- Collections to manage different types of content
- Collection table to see all of your collection items at a glance
- Clear and consistent text editing experience
- Support for tables in rich text fields
- Generated fields to add dynamic data to your collections

More of what’s to come you’ll find on [our website.](https://inbind.app/)
