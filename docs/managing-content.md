# Managing content

Inbind automatically retrieves collections and updated content from Webflow whenever they are changed in Webflow.

## Collection selector

The collection selector allows you to switch between your Webflow collections. All of your CMS collections are retrieved from Webflow and can be viewed using Inbind.

## Collection table

The collection table displays all of the items in your collection and collection fields as columns. 

You can choose to show all collection fields, or select which columns you would like to show. Your last selection will be remembered the next time you open the collection table.

The table is sorted by created date of the item by default. The table can be sorted by any of the columns, with the exception of long content fields, for example blog article texts, and image fields.

Clicking on any of the rows in the collection table will open the item panel to edit an existing collection item.
