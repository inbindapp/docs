# Edit Fields
Edit Fields provides capabilities for editing existing or setting up new fields for your collections, for example powerful programmatic SEO pages based on another collection or simply creating new generated field values.

There are two types of fields in Inbind:

- Regular fields
- Generated fields

## Fields

### **What fields does Inbind support?**

Inbind supports the following field types:

| Field Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Text** | Plain text content without formatting |
| **Rich text** | Formatted text with headings, lists, links, images, and custom code |
| **Number** | Numeric values for quantities, prices, or calculations |
| **Boolean** | True/false values for toggles and checkboxes |
| **Datetime** | Date and time values for scheduling and timestamps |
| **Url** | Web addresses and links |
| **Image** | Single image uploads |
| **Multi image** | Multiple image uploads |
| **File** | Document and file uploads |
| **Video** | Video file uploads |
| **Color** | Color values for styling and design |
| **Choice** | Single selection from predefined options |
| **Reference** | Link to a single item from another collection |
| **Multi reference** | Link to multiple items from another collection |

New fields can be added and existing fields deleted. New fields and their values are by default only visible within Inbind and do not get synced to your connected platforms. You can choose which fields to sync and publish from each collection’s connection settings.

## Generated fields

Generated fields allow you to automatically populate field values using templates based on other fields in the same collection or related collections. They are also used for programmatic SEO by generating an entire collection’s content from a source collection.

For full details on how to create and use generated fields, see the [Generated Fields](./generated-fields) article.
